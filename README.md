# skipgram_scratch
This repository implements skip-gram method for computing word embeddings. 

On the contrary to continuous-bag-of-words approach, Skip-gram uses the central world to predict the surrounding words.

The code uses pytorch and is based on the paper "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space"

Sample result from the code is shown below:
